# TriviaGame
This tribia game show an initial screen with the button play, when the user clicks on it it shows a question qith a series of choices, 
which the user pick one, when the answer is right show Yess and if wrong shows Nooope plus the picture of the right answer in both cases. 
The user is given a limited time to answer the question, after the time runs out, the next question will appear. If the user answer the 
question, also the next question is shown and the timer restart.

The project is useful to learn the use of timers and interval in javascript, plus is fun to work on it!

If you want to add or modify the project, by adding more trivia questions, you can, or improve the functionality of the game, or even make
the scope of the game bigger, by adding cathegories to the functionality.
